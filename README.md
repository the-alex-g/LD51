# Shifting Dungeons
A spark is lit deep in a dark dungeon; the shadows seem alive, reaching out and slowing its progress. Room after room of the dungeon disappears into the gloom. Is escape possible?

When the shadows are next to you, they reduce your speed. Performing a heavy attack increases your speed if it is low.

Controls: WASD or arrow keys to move, space to perform a light attack, enter to perform a heavy attack.

UI: The hourglass at the top of the screen shows how much time remains before another room vanishes. When the hourglass starts blinking, you have about one second left.
The number of light attacks you have available is shown on the left, and the number of heavy attacks available is shown on the right. The bar at the bottom shows your speed.
